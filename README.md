# Car_Populariy_Prediction.
A car company has the data for all the cars that are present in the market. They are planning to introduce some new ones of their own, but first, they want to find out what would be the popularity of the new cars in the market based on each car's attributes.
Given a training dataset, train.csv . train.csv contains the information about a car along with its popularity level. Each row provides information on each car. Information such as buying_price, maintenance_cost, number_of_doors, number_of_seats, etc.
We also provide a test set of  car along with the above attributes excluding popularity, in test.csv. The goal is to predict the popularity of the car based on its attributes.
